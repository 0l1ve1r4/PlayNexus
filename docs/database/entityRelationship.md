5. **Purchase**:

   - Attributes:

   - Relationships:
     - Connects the `Gamer` to the `Game` entity. A gamer can purchase multiple games, and a game can be purchased by multiple gamers.
6. **Publish**:

   - Attributes:
     - `publication_date`: The date when the game was published.
   - Relationships:

### Relationships:

- **Account-Gamer/Publisher**: Every gamer and publisher must have an account, but an account can either be linked to a gamer or a publisher (not both).
- **Gamer-Purchase-Game**: Gamers can make purchases of multiple games, and each game can be purchased by many gamers.
- **Publisher-Publish-Game**: A publisher can publish many games, but each game is published by exactly one publisher.

This ER model provides a clear representation of how accounts, gamers, publishers, games, and purchases interact in a system designed to manage video game distribution and player accounts.
